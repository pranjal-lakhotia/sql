-- problem -> As a data analyst at Uber, it's your job to report the latest metrics for specific groups of Uber users. Some riders create 
--their Uber account the same day they book their first ride; the rider engagement team calls them "in-the-moment" users.
--Uber wants to know the average delay between the day of user sign-up and the day of their 2nd ride. 
--Write a query to pull the average 2nd ride delay for "in-the-moment" Uber users. Round the answer to 2-decimal places.

--solution->
with cte as (SELECT u.user_id,u.registration_date,r.ride_date,ride_date-registration_date as difference_in_dates FROM rides r 
join users u on r.user_id = u.user_id where u.user_id in (SELECT distinct u.user_id FROM rides r join users u on r.user_id = u.user_id
where ride_date = registration_date)),
ranked_cte as (select *,row_number() over(partition by user_id order by ride_date) as rn from cte)
select round(avg(difference_in_dates),2) from ranked_cte where rn = 2;
